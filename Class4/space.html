                             <p><em>Only 1 Million Light Years Away . . . </em> For those
                                 who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds
                                  and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most
                                   certainly changes your perspective. The things that we 
                                   share in our world are far more valuable than those which 
                                   divide us.

                                It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, 
                                was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my 
                                thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

                                 <p><em>It's only a matter of time. . . </em> There can be no 
                                    thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively 
                                    and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter 
                                    how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just
                                     beginning.

                                    As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I
                                     sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man
                                      must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

                                         history have men been able truly to conceive of the
                                          world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the
                                           qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all 
                                           the directions eventually meet, in which there is
                                            no center because every point, or none, is center 
                                            — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
                                             The airman’s earth, if free men make it, will be 
                                             truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
